# Lab 01 – PyInstaller ELF Bootloader Malware Analysis

## Overview
This lab analyzes a 64-bit Linux ELF malware sample packaged using PyInstaller.
The goal is to understand bootloader behavior, path handling logic, and payload
extraction mechanisms.

## Sample Classification
- Type: Trojan (ELF)
- Packing: PyInstaller
- Platform: Linux x64

## High-Level Behavior
- Extracts embedded Python payload to a temporary directory (_MEIXXXXXX)
- Sets environment variables (_MEIPASS2, LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
- Resolves and executes Python bytecode dynamically

## Key Findings
- Path normalization and validation using basename + realpath
- Dynamic loading of Python C-API functions
- Temporary filesystem-based execution

## Status
✔ Bootloader logic understood  
⏳ Payload analysis in progress
